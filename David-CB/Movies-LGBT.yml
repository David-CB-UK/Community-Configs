Bradley Rust Gray's Hitch follows two attractive young guys on a dizzying road trip that leads them toward sexual self-discovery. David Fournier's Majorettes in Space is a witty French spoof of post-modern sex, romance, relationships, the Pope and baton-twirling majorettes. And, Gregory Cooke's $30 is the bittersweet story of a closeted teen presented with a young prostitute on his 16th birthday."

     summary: "In Campfire a lovesick boy scout goes on a camping trip in the country and tries to choose between his girl and his best friend. Particularly Now, In Spring follows a boy athlete as he takes his first steps into adulthood. Saint concerns the scantily-clad death of Saint Sebastian. Finally, Sailor looks at the love between a teenager and a seafarer. One of many pleasures in Defurne's work is the playful and unforced way in which he references the work of other artists from Dreyer and Eisenstein to photographers Herbert List and Pierre et Gilles. Most significantly, Defurne and his regular team have created an allegorical and headily romantic gay aesthetic that draws on a wide range of influences, but is uniquely their own. Defurne's choice of using largely unprofessional actors brings a charming innocence to the performances that complements the magical, overwrought worlds that they inhabit."

     imdb_id: 
 ######### 1910s ########### 
      - tt0007522 # Vingarne (1916), Description: 'There's a very good review here which sums up the many reasons why this can count as the first gay-themed film ever, but you'll be hard pressed to find the subtext from what remains. Dreyer's Michael, based on the same source, is much more ambivalent.'
      - tt0009878 # Different from the Others (1919) {original title-'Anders als die Andern'}, Description: 'First ever gay-themed film starring Conrad Veidt (of 'Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' and 'Casablanca' fame). Conceived by sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld to push for legalization, it led to the reintroduction of film censorship in post-WWI Germany.'
 ######### 1920s ###########
      - tt0013571 # Salomé (1922), Description: 'Was infamously filmed with an all-gay cast, even though that is a matter of contention. Quite obviously very camp, with a number of performers in drag.'
      - tt0015136 # Michael (1924), Description: 'Carl Theodor Dreyer's adaptation of gay writer Herman Bang's novel could be regarded as the first gay-themed narrative film. Contributed to harsher censorship laws banning the subject for decades.'
      - tt0018935 # Sex in Chains (1928) {original title-'Geschlecht in Fesseln'}, Description: 'first film about gender confusion in jail considers homosexuality an affliction and could thereby pass strengthened censorship laws'
      - tt0057490 # The Servant (1963) https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057740/
 ######### 1930s ###########
      - tt0022183 # Mädchen in Uniform (1931), Description: 'first film to touch female homosexuality in a surprisingly overt way and allowing for genuine emotions; could pass German censorship laws because only male homosexuality was penalized. The remake of 1958 is more famous but also more ambivalent.'
      - tt0022737 # Call Her Savage (1932), Description: 'There is a brief scene of what would be the first gay bar in film in this pre-code melodrama.  You can find it on Youtube and don't have to watch the whole thing, as there's no connection to the plot.'
      - tt0122158 # Lot in Sodom (1933), Description: 'released on DVD with 'Salomé' (1923), 'Lot in Sodom' has clear gay subtext, although it is essentially an experimental retelling quite faithful to the Biblical story.'
      - tt0026819 # One Frightened Night (1935) Description: 
 ######### 1940s ###########
      - tt0033712   # Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941) Description: 
      - tt0037008 # Laura (1944), Description: 'with the production code, gay subtext vanished, but many '40s crime films feature presumably homosexual villains, few as obvious as Clifton Webb's Waldo Lydecker, who unlike others isn't portrayed in a defamatory way.'
      - tt0039383 # Fireworks (1947), Description: 'homoerotic experimental no-budget film led to Kenneth Anger's arrest on obscenity charges and, eventually, a Supreme Court ruling declaring the film to be art.'
      - tt0040746 # Rope (1948)
      - tt0041998 # Thirst (1949) {original title-'Törst'}, Description: 'Bergman often touched female homosexuality, but rarely as overtly as in this early piece.'
      - tt0037988 # The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945) 
 ######### 1950s ###########
      - tt0042296 # Caged (1950), Description: 'It's a difficult choice to include the first and campiest women in prison flick as it's chock full of Lesbian stereotypes and equals homosexuality with depravity. Still, it is part of history, and after re-watching it after a number of years, I think anyone with an interest in queer film should watch it for an individual opinion.'
      - tt0043084 # Song of Love (1950) {original title-'Un chant d'amour'}, Description: 'Jean Genet's only film is the first explicitly homoerotic and was consequently banned from exhibition, most notably in the US in 1966, where it was dismissed as obscene.'
      - tt0042803 # Olivia (1951), Description: 'similar to 'Girls in Uniform', but involving more mystery'
      - tt0046521 # I Vitelloni (1953) {original title-'I vitelloni'}, Description: 'While this film is famous for a lot of reasons, it also features the first obvious homosexual hook-up attempt.'
      - tt0048545 # Rebel Without a Cause (1955), Description: 'Many '50s films are said to contain homosexual cyphers as the subject wasn't raised. Sal Mineo as Plato is perhaps most obvious given his real-life homosexuality, but at the time the role made him an idol for (female) teens.'
      - tt0049829 # Tea and Sympathy (1956), Description: 'interesting for making it clear that in the '50s, being gay was viewed maybe not as the ultimate sin, but an affliction worse than death'
      - tt0050128 # The Third Sex (1957) {original title-Anders als du und ich (§ 175)} AKA
      - tt0050128 # Bewildered Youth (1957) {original title-'Anders als du und ich (§ 175)'}, Description: 'every possible stereotype on homosexuality is exploited here by a disgraced Nazi director desperately craving attention. Still, the aged homosexual luring culturally talented young men into his web of sin is oddly fascinating... John Waters would probably call this the ultimate gay bash 'n trash movie.'
      - tt0051964 # Mädchen in Uniform (1958), Description: 'remake of the 1931 film tones the Lesbian aspect down but is perhaps more cult for Lilli Palmer's performance.'
      - tt0053318 # Suddenly, Last Summer (1959), Description: 'while the most overt of Tennessee Williams's stage adaptations in its content owing to Gore Vidal's screenplay, it's the pinnacle of depicting homosexuality as a perverted affliction, and was in fact passed by the MPAA for that very reason.'
      - tt0053428 # Come Dance with Me! (1959) {original title-'Voulez-vous danser avec moi?'}, Description: 'One of French veteran comedy writer Gérard Oury's weaker outings, it does have Brigitte Bardot waltz into a late 50s gay cabaret and could be refreshingly open-minded for the time, but the ending ruins it.'
      - tt0053291 # Some Like It Hot (1959) Description:
 ######### 1960s ###########
      - tt0054403 # The Trials of Oscar Wilde (1960), Description: 'first of many films to focus on Wilde's sodomy conviction, it is surprisingly faithful to the trial's records given the time.'
      - tt0054743 # The Children's Hour (1961), Description: 'William Wyler's remake of his earlier adaptation of Lillian Hellman's play (which erased the homosexual element) marks the first 'A' picture in which gay bashing is portrayed as a social evil - while still holding it to be an affliction.'
      - tt0055506 # A Taste of Honey (1961), Description: ''kitchen sink' adaptation of Shelagh Delaney's play features the first clearly positive (i.e. non-tragical) depiction of a gay character in his relationship with Rita Tushingham's main protagonist.'
      - tt0055597 # Victim (1961), Description: 'first narrative film with homosexuality (with the first use of the actual word) and gay bashing (i. e. blackmail) as the central plot element, with a strong political message towards legalization.'
      - tt0055728 # Advise & Consent (1962), Description: 'A difficult choice to include in this list for me, but if I take Caged, then this one's also a must. It's the first post-war film to show a gay bar, where the climax happens. But ouch - it's an uncomfortable movie to watch for queers. It takes the Fate worse than death approach to a whole new level and doesn't make sense in that regard. It's real-life gay (or bi) Charles Laughton's last film, the production was marred by conflict with real-life homophobe Henry Fonda.'
      - tt0055796 # Billy Budd (1962), Description: 'not the first and not the last adaptation but the least ambiguous owing to bisexual Charles Laughton's performance.'
      - tt0056671 # Walk on the Wild Side (1962), Description: 'Capucine's last film before The Pink Panther as a bisexual prostitute in a abusive relationship with sugar-mommy Barbara Stanwyck, Jane Fonda as a nymphomaniac and Anne Baxter as a motherly Mexican leave little room for a hapless leading man. It's a bungled adaptation of Nelson Algren's completely different and even more convoluted novel. But it's relatively blameless, leading critics at the time to dismiss the film as lewd. Well, it's camp for sure.'
      - tt0138329 # Blonde Cobra (1963), Description: 'experimental cross-dressing super-8 movie added to the '1001 films you must watch before you die' list. Personally I don't see why.'
      - tt0054880 # Flaming Creatures (1963), Description: 'experimental film full of sexual ambiguity seized upon release in a NYC theater and banned for being obscene. Also on '1001 films you must watch before you die' list for whatever reason.'
      - tt0058555 # Scorpio Rising (1963), Description: 'Anger's biker fetish experimental film caused controversy in spite of complete lack of subject matter and led to another obscenity trial, ruled in his favor. That doesn't make it any less non-sequitur.'
      - tt0057244 # The Leather Boys (1964), Description: 'notwithstanding the misleading title which refers to bike gangs, there is an open gay angle in this kitchen sink classic.'
      - tt0057960 # Love Meetings (1964) {original title-'Comizi d'amore'}, Description: 'Oddly, Pasolini's only film in which he directly addresses homosexuality - in a broader context - is this fascinating documentary in which he asks people about their views on sex'
      - tt0058326 # Swastika (1964) {original title-'Manji'}, Description: 'Again a very misleading title (Manji refers to the Buddhist symbol) for perhaps the first openly erotic Lesbian love story.'
      - tt0057842 # This Special Friendship (1964) {original title-'Les amitiés particulières'}, Description: 'Adaptation of Roger Peyrefitte's novel features a first gay coming-of-age story featuring actual minors. Peyrefitte met his longtime companion on the set who was one of the extras (and 12 years old at the time).'
      - tt0062016 # My Hustler (1965), Description: 'Primitive like most of Warhol's films, this one is probably the most contemporarily significant as it points out how long many gay assets and clichés have been around.'
      - tt0232954 # Winter Kept Us Warm (1965), Description: 'Low-budget gay romance was lightyears ahead of its time and the first Canadian film invited to Cannes'
      - tt0059919 # With Beauty and Sorrow (1965) {original title-'Utsukushisa to kanashimi to'}, Description: 'A Lesbian relationship is at the center of Shinoda's elegant Kawabata adaptation, meant to be symbolic rather than realistic. Still, compared to Hollywood at the time it's very daring.'
      - tt0060395 # The Family Way (1966)  Description:
      - tt0060891 # The Nun (1966) {original title-'La religieuse'}, Description: 'A scathing portrayal of women's status in the 18th century and Rivette's most accessible film. The Lesbian mother superior played by Liselotte Pulver (most famous as James Cagney's secretary in One Two Three) is a fate worse than death character, but convincingly so given Diderot's scandalous enlightenment novel. It's not really sympathetic to homosexuality but rather depicts Lesbianism as an inevitable result of confinement. The film was forbidden right after its Cannes premiere on the grounds of hurting the sentiments of the Catholic population, and only released a year later in altered form.'
      - tt0060574 # Young Törless (1966) {original title-'Der junge Törless'}, Description: 'I'm at odds whether one can truly call this adaptation of Robert Musil's novella gay-related, it's more of a social portrait (read my review if you like), but it does highlight the psychological association of homosexual acts with (criminal) degeneration, and shows where this misconception may have originated.'
      - tt0061403 # Bike Boy (1967), Description: 'I'm not quite sure if one could count any of Warhol / Morrissey's outings as LGBT. They're usually ramblings of not particularly sympathetic narcissists, and this one's no exception. It does have some queer background talk ripe with stereotypes, but maybe that's just how the New York scene was just then.'
      - tt0144304 # The Boy and the Wind (1967) {original title-'O Menino e o Vento'}, Description: 'Very obscure Brazilian one-of-a-kind supernatural social witchhunt drama is a very elegant allegory on perhaps less homosexuals as social outcasts - even though that does figure - but more the tendency to incriminate difference in general.'
      - tt0062990 # The Fox (1967), Description: 'Made in the year the production code was abandoned, thus it's the first Anglophone film with masturbation and a detailed description of rape. A Bergmanesque character study which flirts with being a thriller. The ending prevents it from being a Lesbian love story.'
      - tt0062144 # Portrait of Jason (1967), Description: 'Shirley Clarke's famous monologue of a gay black hustler could be called the first gay-themed documentary. Albeit simple, it's definitely superior to Warhol's films of the period.'
      - tt0063462 # The Producers (1967), Description: 'Can be seen as 'anti-gay' because of the stereotypes, but then again Mel Brooks is all about stereotypes, and everyone gets roasted it his most famous film. As ludicrous as the gay characters may seem, they're proud and out and therefore a progress to the self-loathing gay characters up to then.'
      - tt0062185 # Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967) Description: 'Adaptation of Carson McCullers 1941 novel doesn't really succeed in dealing with the topic of repressed homosexuality as overtly as the novel does, but makes for interesting (i.e. odd) viewing since it tries so desperately to conceal what the story is all about.'
      - tt0062728 # Les Biches (1968) {original title-'Les biches'}, Description: 'Menage à trois between two women and a man is, like so much of Chabrol, sensationalist and perfectly photographed. Of course, the female couple is bi instead of Lesbian, and share and compete for the same man... a dirty old man's fantasy but stylish to the hilt.'
      - tt0063203 # Black Lizard (1968) {original title-'Kuro tokage'}, Description: 'Camp classic starring writer Yukio Mishima's drag queen lover Akihiro Maruyama as the femme fatale cat burglar.'
      - tt0062883 # The Detective (1968), Description: 'Most gays will find the equation of corruption and homosexuality this film insinuates revolting, but it's a good look at the contemporary scene and how closeted and cliché everything was in Stonewall year.'
      - tt0062979 # Flesh (1968), Description: 'Not a gay-themed film per se, it's often included in anthologies owing to lots of full frontal nudity, a background of hustlers, and a scene involving the conversation of two drag queens. It is, however, 8mm quality, badly edited and barely watchable.'
      - tt0063850 # If.... (1968) Description:
      - tt0062461 # Gates to Paradise (1968), Description: 'Not as overt as the novel but close enough in terms of the two male lead's relationship, surprising considering the historical setting.'
      - tt0063185 # The Killing of Sister George (1968), Description: 'Robert Aldrich's adaptation of Frank Marcus' play is the first unmitigated look at a Lesbian relationship, albeit unfortunately taking an inevitably tragic turn.'
      - tt0063236 # Lonesome Cowboys (1968), Description: 'Again, not really LGBT in my opinion but most people would probably consider it so. Again, it seems to me a rather unsympathetic display of exhibitionism by a bunch of addicts and naive pretty faces.'
      - tt0063585 # The Sergeant (1968), Description: 'Finally got to see it. Features a great performance by Rod Steiger as a  but unfortunately also a rather weak script.'
      - tt0063678 # Teorema (1968), Description: 'While Pasolini never directed a truly gay-themed film in spite of his homosexuality - which would have been impossible in Italy - many of his films have allusions, this one being the most obvious.'
      - tt0064556 # Black Rose (1969) {original title-'Kuro bara no yakata'}, Description: 'Second film starring Akihiro Maruyama as a femme fatale and perhaps the most ravishing portrayal of a drag queen (whose real sex is never mentioned) becoming total ruler of all men unfortunate enough to meet her.'
      - tt0064940 # Satyricon (1969) {original title-'Fellini - Satyricon'}, Description: 'Chock full of gay allusions but uses those as a cheap shock element, therefore considered one of Fellini's few duds.'
      - tt0064068 # Funeral Parade of Roses (1969) {original title-'Bara no sôretsu'}, Description: 'First Trans-themed film instrumental to establishing an identity for Tokyo's gay underground in the '60s - i.e. the longest-running gay mag was called 'barazoku' = rose tribe, a long-standing synonym for gays.'
      - tt0064363 # The Gay Deceivers (1969), Description: 'Rather silly romantic comedy with a gay angle and every imaginable stereotype, it's still somewhat interesting for real-life gay Michael Greer's landlord queen and a surprise ending.'
      - tt0064507 # Hunting Scenes from Bavaria (1969) {original title-'Jagdszenen aus Niederbayern'}, Description: 'One of the first New German Cinema films and also the first one to address the subject of gay discrimination.'
      - tt0064665 # Midnight Cowboy (1969), Description: 'Oscar-winning hustler portrait with gay subtext strong enough to earn the film an 'X' rating, prompting the MPAA to modify its standards. Its gay angle is so-so owing to the self-loathing aspect of Hoffman's character.'
      - tt0065031 # Staircase (1969), Description: 'Mostly vilified for its rampant display of stereotypes, but it's a captivating, if at times horrifying, experience for Burton's and Harrison's attempts at mimicking a relationship.'
      - tt0066579 # Women in Love (1969), Description: 'Ken Russell's confusing D.H. Lawrence adaptation highlights the relationship between the male leads, the film's most controversial scene contained the first mainstream shots of male genitalia.'
 ######### 1970s ###########
      - tt0065488 # The Boys in the Band (1970), Description: 'first film with exclusively gay protagonists is widely considered a milestone in queer cinema, still looks fresh in terms of physical language and banter, and underscores how much of a social development there has been since.'
      - tt0065700 # Entertaining Mr Sloane (1970), Description: 'mellowed down version of Joe Orton's famous play, but interesting (in an unpleasant way) for its queasy approach'
      - tt0066115 # Myra Breckinridge (1970), Description: 'drivel with the tenacity to make one of the first male rape scenes in film one giant joke, still interesting to watch for the stereotypes and plot subtexts. And of course there's Welch as a glamour-obsessed post-op trans. Trashy but essential.'
      - tt0359910 # Roll On Four O'Clock (1970) Description: Set in a city comprehensive school of low expectations and ambitions. Pupil Latimer does not conform to the macho culture and is labeled a homosexual, leading to bullying by both the pupils and some of the teachers. **  ITV Sunday Night Theatre - https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0359910/
      - tt0066392 # Something for Everyone (1970), Description: 'involves (once again) a manipulative bisexual young man sneaking his way into the upper class by sex - portraying homosexuality as high society depravity. Interesting because it feels so anachronistic.'
      - tt0066482 # Trash ( 1970) - https://archive.org/details/trash-1970 (1970) Description: 
      - tt0066921 # A Clockwork Orange (1971) Description: 
      - tt0066109 # The Music Lovers (1971), Description: 'often reviled for its idiosyncratic focus on the self-loathing aspect of Tchaikovsky's homosexuality (and how it drives his wife into nymphomaniac insanity), it still has Richard Chamberlain in his only gay-themed role.'
      - tt0067690 # Daughters of Darkness (1971) {original title-'Les lèvres rouges'}, Description: 'The Lesbian vampire shtick is of course clearly exploitative and hardly an expression of sexual liberation, but this particular film is heavily symbolic and easily the classiest of the genre.'
      - tt0067445 # Death in Venice (1971) {original title-'Morte a Venezia'}, Description: 'Visconti's adaptation is arguably the most artistic rendition of Platonic homo-eroticism. Read Björn Andresen's remarks on the shoot on the title page, though - it wasn't easy to be the boy who played Tadzio.'
      - tt0065622 # The Decameron (1971) {original title-'Il Decameron'}, Description: 'features one humoristic gay-themed episode, but as always Pasolini carefully avoids any realistic approach to the subject.'
      - tt0067112 # Fortune and Men's Eyes (1971), Description: 'adaptation of John Herbert's play with strong homoerotic (rape) imagery and a great Michael Greer as prison 'Queeny' - a part which might have inspired the Rocky Horror Picture Show'
      - tt0065393 # Les amis (1971), Description: 'naturalistic description of a man-boy relationship which could be interpreted as disturbing these days, but in the 70s sensitivities were obviously different - that's probably pretty much what it was like, and - who knows? - still is in conservative societies.'
      - tt0066136 # It Is Not the Homosexual Who Is Perverse, But the Society in Which He Lives (1971) {original title-'Nicht der Homosexuelle ist pervers, sondern die Situation, in der er lebt'}, Description: 'Rosa von Praunheim's first and most famous take on gay life in West Germany just after it was decriminalized; the narrative text is still the most poignant critique of gay life after four decades - for that you'll have to forgive abysmal acting. His autobiography 'Sex and Career', which has much of the narrative script, is better.'
      - tt0198360 # The Murdered House (1971) {original title-'A Casa Assassinada'}, Description: 'adaptation of one of those Latin American family chronicles which make such good reads, it's remarkable for portraying its gay characters as integral personalities rather than stereotypes (although there's a good deal of flamboyance)'
      - tt0067580 # Pink Narcissus (1971), Description: 'Bidgood's glamour kitsch celebrating male beauty had a lasting influence on gay art, especially the photographers Pierre et Gilles.'
      - tt0067771 # Some of My Best Friends Are... (1971), Description: 'bit of a time travel experience available on Youtube'
      - tt0067805 # Sunday Bloody Sunday (1971), Description: 'love triangle with a successful, less tragical gay character than in Schlesinger's previous film 'Midnight Cowboy'.'
      - tt0067952 # Villain (1971), Description: 'many people know of Burton's gay performance in 'Staircase', fewer know of his portrayal of a sadistic gay gangster. It's a horror show of clichés, yet oddly fascinates because of the abusive relation the principal characters have.'
      - tt0068278 # The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (1972) {original title-'Die bitteren Tränen der Petra von Kant'}, Description: 'Fassbender's Lesbian love story could be criticized for a good deal of self-loathing, but artistically it's one of his best.'
      - tt2395484 # A Ton of Grass Goes to Pot (1972) Description: 
      - tt0068327 # Cabaret (1972), Description: 'from a gay viewpoint, the brilliant adaptation of Isherwood's most famous book is more interesting for how much of the gay content had been left out, while Fosse still found ways to leave it in - namely through Joel Grey's Oscar-winning performance and Michael York's notorious 'confession'.'
      - tt0068726 # I Want What I Want (1972), Description: 'First serious Anglophone trans-themed film I'm aware of has the lead performed by Anne Heywood, Sandy Dennis' bi lover in The Fox. She's not convincing as a man at all, so it starts very oddly, but by and by the theme is presented in an adequate, if somewhat stiff manner.'
      - tt0067425 # My Dearest Senorita (1972) {original title-'Mi querida señorita'}, Description: 'A better trans-themed film from Spain, very subtle as the queer theme is embedded in an unrelated story. Must have caused quite a stir at the times but I have little information about it.'
      - tt0069054 # Our Miss Fred (1972) Description: 
      - tt0069089 # Pink Flamingos (1972), Description: 'Some people may wonder, where's John Waters in this list? So I just include his most notorious classic to maintain that his films are not really LGBT in my view. This one's a camp classic, definitely worth watching, and many people see it as an expression of post-Stonewall liberation. But it's exploitative trash as well, and if I exclude countless Spanish Lesbian vampire flicks of that era, I'm really not sure if it's OK to put this one in.'
      - tt0071508 # Flesh for Frankenstein (1973) Description: 
      - tt0068883 # Ludwig (1973), Description: 'Visconti's biopic of Bavaria's last king contains his most daring gay imagery, mirroring his relationship with his frequent star Helmut Berger.'
      - tt0070957 # Tenderness of the Wolves (1973) {original title-'Die Zärtlichkeit der Wölfe'}, Description: 'best film of one of the worst directors ever, this Fassbender-written adaptation of notorious cannibal Fritz Haarman is accurate yet sensationalist'
      - tt0071690 # I, You, He, She (1974) {original title-'Je tu il elle'}, Description: 'Another difficult choice. Is a film LGBT-related because it has a 15-minute Lesbian sex scene at the end, with no comprehensible connection to the rest, and without the slightest pretense of coherency? Or is this just artsy, dreary, boring sexploitation? Make up your own mind, but be warned: you may find this revoltingly uninteresting.'
      - tt0071690  # Je, tu, il, elle (1974) {Original title: Je tu il elle} {dir-Chantal Akerman, Belgium; experimental film with lesbian relationship} 
      - tt0072362 # A Very Natural Thing (1974), Description: 'naturalistic portrayal of gay life in NYC, many aspects of which still seem to linger, and a reminder of how the Pride movement started.'
      - tt0072890 # Dog Day Afternoon (1975), Description: ''true life better than fiction' - classic tale of a heist gone wrong cannot really be called gay-themed because that's just a twist to real-life John Wojtowicz's story, but one can argue that it's remarkable that Warner Bros. didn't supress that story element.'
      - tt0072976 # Fox and His Friends (1975) {original title-'Faustrecht der Freiheit'}, Description: 'Fassbender's most openly gay film is actually an adaptation of a literary classic, but remodeled to depict the German gay scene.'
      - tt0073438 # The Naked Civil Servant (1975), Description: 'starring John Hurt in a BAFTA-winning performance he arguably never surpassed, this has been voted #4 in the BFI's all-time best TV movie poll. In my view one of the best gay-themed films ever made, owing of course to Quentin Crisp's inimitable personality.'
      - tt0073540 # Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), Description: 'Peter Weir's masterpiece has often been interpreted in a Lesbian context, but I've never felt so sure about that... decided to list it here after consulting with a Lesbian friend. It's one of the most ambiguous films ever made, after all.'
      - tt0073629 # The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), Description: ''don't dream it, be it' - the greatest cult classic of all time isn't really about sexual orientation, but a satire on '50s mores versus '60s/'70s liberation - yet much more enjoyable than many '90s 'It's OK' movies.'
      - tt0073650 # Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom (1975) {original title-'Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma'}, Description: 'Pasolini's last and most notorious film associates homosexual acts with the depravity of the Fascist elite and could therefore be regarded as an anti-gay by a gay director - a premise under which it makes some odd sense'
      - tt0257099 # Saturday Night at the Baths (1975), Description: 'interesting for displaying the show acts that used to be common in the NYC scene, but not much of a story.'
      - tt0216668 # David Is Homosexual (1976) Description: 
      - tt0074888 # La meilleure façon de marcher (1976) Description: 'deals with gay bashing as a result of repressed sexuality and is still relevant in this regard.'
      - tt0073839 # Un enfant dans la foule (1976) Description: 'More a coming-of-age story, director Gérard Blain works on his adolescent traumas in this autobiographic retelling of a rebellious teen turning tricks in occupied WWII Paris. Not as sympathetic to gays as his Les Amis but a much better film.'
      - tt0073196 # Je t'aime moi non plus (1976) Description: 'Another film that actually should not be on this list as it's unabashedly exploitative, it's also a one-of-a-kind surreal experience. The gay theme is milked for shock yet off-the-charts unrealistic, and one cannot help but wonder about uber-hetero Serge Gainsbourg's motivation for (ab)using his real-life partner Jane Birkin, plus naming the film after their biggest hit. However, it's Joe Dallessandro's only film in which he is really gay.'
      - tt0222067 # Johan (1976), Description: 'very overt and underground, but camera-wise almost unwatchable.'
      - tt0074973 # Norman... Is That You? (1976), Description: 'First black gay-themed film is a cliché-riddled theater piece, but quite sympathetic and once again an interesting time-travel experience.'
      - tt0075144 # The Ritz (1976), Description: 'extremely silly cult comedy set in a gay bathhouse; the variety show in there makes for an odd time-travel experience.'
      - tt0075177 # Sebastiane (1976), Description: 'Derek Jarman's most famous film is a bit of a drab to watch these days, as it could be accused of pretentiousness. Back in the day it probably made many mouths water.'
      - tt0075655 # Alexander: The Other Side of Dawn (1977), Description: 'focus is on teenage runaways with the main character being a kept boy just a sub-plot, but that adds up quite nicely in this time piece which caused quite a stir. The sugar daddy thing isn't so unrealistic either.'
      - tt0074273 # Change of Sex (1977) {original title-'Cambio de sexo'}, Description: 'Later megastar Victoria Abril plays a trans woman in her first lead role and is actually quite convincing as a young man, with fellow Almodóvar regular Bibi Andersen co-starring. Aranda goes for some lurid shots, the story is a bit kitsch but overall it's OK to watch.'
      - tt1273656 # Come Spy with Me (1977) Description: 
      - tt0076280 # The Consequence (1977) {original title-'Die Konsequenz'}, Description: 'Surprising for Wolfgang Petersen's modest direction and Jürgen Prochnow's mature acting, since both would go on to make 'Das Boot', this is one of the best early gay-themed films I know.'
      - tt0076837 # El transexual (1977), Description: 'Another Spanish trans-themed film, quite similar story to Cambio de sexo but this one's a dud, starring sex symbol Agata Lys who wasn't the best actress. Why so many Spanish LGBT titles that year? With dictator Franco's death in 1975, censorship had ended, making Spanish media content one of the most liberated for a number of years.'
      - tt0075069 # Hidden Pleasures (1977) {original title-'Los placeres ocultos'}, Description: 'was celebrated at the time for being the first gay-themed Spanish film with full exposure, and director Eloy de la Iglesia was gay. But I find his work quite problematic, as his older man-younger man relationships tend to portray the sugar daddy as a troubled individual abused by criminal juveniles. Still, this is easily his best film.'
      - tt0076378 # Me siento extraña (1977), Description: 'Another Spanish LGBT entry that year was the first Spanish-language Lesbian romance with Rocio Durcal, who regretted doing the film, stopped acting and became a very successful singer. Barbara Rey's career also took a dive because the film was attacked for its gay content, but ultimately she became a very famous TV host. In spite of the critics, the film was a success in relation to screens number.'
      - tt0076513 # Outrageous! (1977), Description: 'bio retracing Craig Russell's career as a female impersonator touring gay clubs is interesting for depicting the scene as it once was.'
      - tt0076085 # A Special Day (1977) {original title-'Una giornata particolare'}, Description: 'none less than Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni in the first film to address the topic of persecution of homosexuals during Fascism.'
      - tt0075616 # To an Unknown God (1977) {original title-'A un Dios desconocido'}, Description: 'first Spanish film to address the subject of homosexuality head-on, the film deals with an ageing magician recalling his love affair with gay poet (and Nobel laureate) Garcia Lorca.'
      - tt0199143 # Word Is Out (1977), Description: 'easily the best of the 70s gay-themed documentaries and an important historical document on film.'
      - tt0077435 # A Different Story (1978), Description: 'Much vilified for insinuating that people can change their orientations like shirts, this fluffy piece doesn't actually quite do that, and suffers more from Perry King's lack of talent than a predictable script.'
      - tt0077164 # My Father, My Mother (1978) {original title-'Ang Tatay Kong Nanay'}, Description: 'In spite of very bad image quality and quite a few stereotypes, this one's a real gem, owing to Dolphy, one of the Philippines' biggest stars. He wasn't gay/trans in real life but often took roles like this to push for greater acceptance. His performance and a good story make this one of the most watch-worthy queer films of the '70s.'
      - tt29703523 # Caligula: The Ultimate Cut (1978) Description:
      - tt0077438 # Confessions of a Congressman (1978) {original title-'El diputado'}, Description: 'Again, Eloy de Iglesia puts an older man-younger boy relationship at the center of what is otherwise a political conspiracy thriller. This can be read as a comment on the transitioning of Spain at the time but it's not written well.'
      - tt0076336 # The Place Without Limits (1978) {original title-'El lugar sin límites'}, Description: 'adaptation of Chilean gay writer José Donoso's novel centered on a Transvestite, this is a very bold, excessive marvel of a film, but of course tragedy ensues.'
      - tt0077729 # In a Year with 13 Moons (1978) {original title-'In einem Jahr mit 13 Monden'}, Description: 'Fassbender's piece on a trans woman goes deeply psychoanalytical and paints a far too depressing and hopeless picture in my view, but highlights his own gender confusion. Still, not a film to watch for younger trans people, I would presume.'
      - tt0077288 # La Cage aux Folles (1978) {original title-'La cage aux folles'}, Description: 'cult comedy was the first gay-themed film which was a huge hit even with straight audiences, and won the foreign film Golden Globe. Chock full of clichés, it's nevertheless honestly sympathetic.'
      - tt0076152 # A Man Called Autumn Flower (1978) {original title-'Un hombre llamado Flor de Otoño'}, Description: 'Perhaps the most interesting of the 70s post-Franco gay films, as this one combines anti-fascist resistance with underground culture and a love story, which makes for a pretty good, albeit tragic, story.'
      - tt0253366 # Ocana, an Intermittent Portrait (1978) {original title-'Ocaña, retrat intermitent'}, Description: 'Naive painter and public happening artist José Pérez Ocaña was a local hero of Barcelona during Spain's transition period and a queer idol, one of the first outspoken LGBT activists. He talked a lot in this film, with much more verve than usual in other docus of that time. There's a more recent film about him but this one captures the mood of the era.'
      - tt0077928 # Midnight Express (1978) Description:
      - tt0080662 # You Are Not Alone (1978) {original title-'Du er ikke alene'}, Description: 'coming-of-age story calling for tolerance and solidarity'
      - tt0078794 # Army of Lovers or Revolt of the Perverts (1979) {original title-'Armee der Liebenden oder Revolte der Perversen'}, Description: 'von Praunheim's docu on the emergence of the US Pride movement before AIDS, not as known as it deserves to be.'
      - tt0079107 # Das Ende des Regenbogens (1979), Description: 'It's a coming-of-age drama and not really gay-themed, as the lead turns tricks for money but is presented as straight. His clients are bystanders and have no background. It's interesting for showing the rent boy scene in a non-judgmental way, but that also makes it rather flat.'
      - tt0079111 # Ernesto (1979), Description: 'adaptation of a posthumously published novel by Umberto Saba, quite explicit yet quite glossy'
      - tt0074541 # Forbidden Letters (1979) Description:
      - tt0219992 # Race d'Ep (1979), Description: 'an ideological docu re-enacting (in large part) photographer Wilhelm von Gloeden's settings accompanied by a fake Sicilian narrator. Since those picture are borderline pedo, it's an unfortunate mix, but not uncommon at the time.'
      - tt0079702 # La patata bollente (1979), Description: 'fluffy comedy with very serious undertones, this was quite a hit at the time and combines cheap laughs with a plea for social conscience.'
      - tt0079843 # Saint Jack (1979), Description: 'hard to come by Bogdanovich classic features - of all people - one-time Bond George Lazenby in a hustler set-up. Not gay-themed but an intresting period piece for sure.'
      - tt0064963 # The Set (1979) Description: 
      - tt0079054 # To Forget Venice (1979) {original title-'Dimenticare Venezia'}, Description: 'maybe the most sophisticated gay-themed film of the '70s, Brusati's masterpiece is cryptic but elegant.'
      - tt0080051 # Twice a Woman (1979) {original title-'Twee vrouwen'}, Description: 'First European Lesbian-themed film of note, it's unfortunately heavily constructed as it's a literary adaptation, but nevertheless remarkable for focusing on the characters' inner workings instead of their sex.'
      - tt0082829 # Nous étions un seul homme (1979), Description: 'WWII gay romance between a German soldier in hiding and a French village idiot, quite a story regarding the time.'
      - tt0128265 # Immacolata e Concetta, l'altra gelosia (1979), Description: 'This is said to be the first Italian Lesbian romance, but I haven't been able to find it.'
 ######### 1980s ###########
      - tt0080569 # Cruising (1980), Description: 'Friedman's other, more infamous gay-themed film is interesting for the intense debate it incited, less for its unconvincing story.'

  # 1981 #
      - tt0078993 # La confusion des sentiments (1981), Description: 'Finally saw this made-for-TV Stefan Zweig adaptation with Michel Piccoli. Apart from a very attractive young lead, it looks pretty dated even for early 80s standards, which is probably why it's so obscure.'
      - tt0167856 # Culo e camicia (1981), Description: '2nd episode in this two-in-one is borderline exploitative comedy, kind of a poor man's La cage aux folles'
      - tt0182338 # Nessuno è perfetto (1981), Description: 'by no means perfect rom com stars Ornella Muti as a trans woman, and is therefore interesting to watch just for her gorgeousness. The story is surprisingly complicated for Italian comedy of the time.'
      - tt0088784 # The Kiss (1981) {original title-'O Beijo No Asfalto'}, Description: 'stage adaptation of a popular theater piece of the time,this is more an examination of machismo under threat than homosexuality itself, which is more of a catalyst.'

      - tt0083962 # Forty Deuce (1982), Description: 'Paul Morrissey's most openly gay (i.e. least camp) film stars Kevin Bacon, but as usual with that director, it's all about depravity.'
      - tt0084228 # Labyrinth of Passion (1982) {original title-'Laberinto de pasiones'}, Description: 'Almodóvar's 2nd film is a wild array of ambiguous sexuality, including a very young Antonio Banderas as a gay Iranian wannabe terrorist.'
      - tt0085852 # Liquid Sky (1982), Description: 'Lesbian underground SciFi cult classic'
      - tt0084293 # Making Love (1982), Description: 'first mainstream Hollywood gay-themed drama memorable for Kate Jackson's bewildered wife of a bisexual husband and Harry Hamlin's commitment problems.'

      - tt0084565 # Querelle (1982), Description: 'Fassbender's adaptation of Genet's most explicit novel doesn't shy away from sexually charged imagery, but doesn't succeed in capturing its atmosphere.'

      - tt0084865 # Victor/Victoria (1982), Description: 'now can this brillliant gender-bending musical featuring everybody involved at their absolute peak be called 'gay-related'? Robert Preston's Toddy is still the best gay character coming out of Hollywood for me, but some of my friends feel it's all a bit too gaudy, merry and superficial. To each his own - it's one of my all-time favorites.'

      - tt0085701 # The Hunger (1983), Description: 'It's a bit exploitative on the gay angle - however, not offensively so, like 'Basic Instinct' for instance. However, it was the first film involving Lesbian sex between A-list actresses, sparking the L-themed magazine Deneuve - which had to change its name to Curve following a lwasuit by the actress, though.'

      - tt0086377 # Streamers (1983), Description: 'less focus on the gay topic rather than examining psychological insecurities - as so often in Altman films. '3 Women' (1977) may carry a much stronger gay content but it's such a difficult film that I dare not interpret it in that context.'
